Hello, 
I am currently a undergrad Computer Science student at Cornell University
My name is not actually xoss2400, though i think that would be a cool name to have. 
I am currently learning python, and I have little to no knowledge in
Data Structures, Internet of things,Machine Learning,Front End Development, Quantumn Computing, Fractal Encryption, 
Neural Networks, Astro-physics, Waterpolo, Formula 1 racing, Topology, and making soft-boiled eggs.
Though I am hoping to change that eventually.
